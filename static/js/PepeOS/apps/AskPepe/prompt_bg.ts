It originally had its own Layer 1 blockchain but recently migrated to Ethereum as an ERC-20. $PEPE and $PEPECOIN are not the same, PepeCoin is a legitimate project from 2016 wheras $PEPE is a scam that has duped many unsuspecting victims. Bittrex and a number of other exchanges listed the project under the name Memetic due to controversy surrounding the Rare Pepe meme during the 2016 US Presidential Election. The website is pepecoin.io, the ticker is $PEPECOIN, the contract address is 0xa9e8acf069c58aec8825542845fd754e41a9489a, the total supply is 133,769,420 PEPECOIN. The developers building Pepecoin are crypto OGs and are building a meme-based operating systemm comprising of a suite of SocialFI platforms wrapped around a DeFi ecosystem. So users can chat, hang out and entertain themselves while they trade. The utility of PepeCoin is to be the native token of the PepeOS ecosystem, special privileges will be given to $PEPECOIN holders and the token will be used in the upcoming DeFi and SocialFi platforms. PepeCoin is no longer using the Memetic name.";

export const pepecoinHistory = `PepeCoin was launched on March 5th 2016 making it one of the earliest memecoins in existence alonside Dogecoin. It was originally launched using its own Proof-of-Work Layer 1 blockchain network meaning the coins were distributed via mining (Like Dogecoin & Bitcoin), and not via an ICO or smart contract. The project was listed on Bittrex and several other exchanges in 2017 under the name "Memetic" as the exchange owners were concerned about the controversy surrounding Pepe the frog during the 2016 US Presidential election (kek, butthurt!). On March 15th of 2017 Vitalik Buterin humorously tweeted about an Enterprise PepeCoin Alliance. In April on 2023 PepeCoin migrated to the Ethereum network in order to leverage EVM smart contract functionality to execute on a grander vision. PepeCoin continues to exist on Ethereum today as an ERC-20 token and on the 5th of November 2023 released PepeOS and Pepe Messenger (also known as kek.chat), these platforms server as the foundation for the ecosystem PepeCoin will be building. You can read more about PepeCoin's rich history on the History page of the Pepe Explorer.`;

export const realPepe = `PepeCoin was launched in 2016 originally under the ticker $PEPE, however during the migration to the Ethereum network the project was sadly frontrun by a less-than-ethical project claiming the same ticker. The PepeCoin developers thus decided to launch with the ticker $PEPECOIN for the migrated token. Despite this, the PepeCoin project's rich online footprint dating back to 2016 makes it quite clear which of the two is the authentic project.`;
