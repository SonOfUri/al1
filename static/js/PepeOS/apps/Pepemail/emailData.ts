Kek.\n\nThe paper is available at:\n[REDACTED]\n\nThe main properties:\nDouble-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.\nPepes remain super rare and dank.\nNo mint or other trusted parties.\nParticipants can be anonymous.\nNew memes are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.\nThe proof-of-work for new meme generation also powers the network to prevent double-spending.\n\nPepecoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Meme System\n\nAbstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic memes would allow online sharing to be done directly from one user to another without the need for a centralized platform. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps memes by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed but also proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Memes are broadcasted on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\n\nFull paper at:\n[REDACTED]\n\nSatoshi Pepemoto",
